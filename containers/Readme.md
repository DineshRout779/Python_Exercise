# Containers

A container is a special object that can store and retrieve
other objects (like strings).

## Lists

A list is a mutable container that stores objects in a specific order.
When a container is mutable it means the objects in the container can change
objects that can be added and removed from the container. It can also contain duplicate values.

In python, a list is defined as follows,
```python
fruits = list()
print(fruits)
>> []

or

Fruits = ["apple","banana","mango"]
print(fruits) 
>> ['apple','banana','mango']
```
